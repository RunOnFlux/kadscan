## Refactor objective (must hold true)
- Preserve existing behavior and UX.
- No new frameworks or global switches. Do NOT enable TS strict globally, add Pinia, or add test suites.
- Data path: components/pages -> composables -> Nuxt `server/api/*` -> external indexer (GraphQL). No direct external fetches in `.vue`.
- Work on ONE page at a time. Update `TODO.md` and pause for manual review before cascading.

## Required process (checklist per page)
1) Inventory dependencies: components, composables, utils, `server/api/*`, route params/query, assets.
2) Trace data flow end-to-end; make SSR-safe (`useAsyncData`/`useFetch` patterns). Eliminate direct external calls in `.vue`.
3) Normalize reactive state: consolidate refs, prefer `computed` over watchers, remove redundant state.
4) Extract/relocate logic: move pure/duplicated helpers to appropriate composables/utils. Avoid behavior changes.
5) API handling: composables call Nuxt API; standardize loading/error/empty shapes surfaced from composables.
6) Types: add/strengthen local types and composable return types. Avoid `any`. Do not change global TS config.
7) Organize files per layout below and group/sort imports (vue/nuxt -> third-party -> internal).
8) Comments: concise docstrings explaining "why" for nontrivial logic.
9) Accessibility/performance: keys on v-for, avoid heavy reactive arrays when not needed, memoize derived data.
10) Impact analysis: for each changed composable/util, list all consumers and add cascade items to `TODO.md`.
11) Update `TODO.md` progress and stop for manual review before proceeding to cascade tasks.
12) Prefer reuse of existing helpers in `composables/string.ts`, `composables/number.ts`, or domain composables before adding new ones.
13) SSR mode changes require explicit approval per page; default to preserving current behavior.
14) New composables must be re-entrant, expose reactive state where relevant, and perform robust cleanup.
15) Prefer adding new composables over changing interfaces of widely used ones. Interface changes require explicit approval and cascade planning.

## Composable interface standard (per page)
- Return shape includes at minimum: `{ data, loading, error }` where `data` is typed, `loading`/`error` are reactive.
- Provide `isEmpty` as a computed when empty semantics are relevant to the page.
- Keep types local to the composable or page; export only when strictly necessary.
- Avoid side effects during setup; start effects explicitly and ensure cleanup.

## Post-edit verification (must be checked in `TODO.md`)
- SFC order and import grouping applied.
- Skeleton/spinner usage preserved per current UX.
- Initial-load skeleton must not show during background polling; content stays visible while polling.
- No direct external fetches in pages/components.
- No console errors or warnings.
 - No public interface changes to widely used composables or shared components without explicit approval.

## SFC layout order (enforced when editing)
Template
<script setup>
- Imports
- Local types
- Props/Emits
- Constants
- Reactive State (refs/reactive)
- Computed
- Watchers
- Lifecycle hooks
- Functions (top-down helpers, then event handlers)
</script>
Styles (if present)

## Acceptance criteria
- Behavior unchanged; no console errors; lints/build pass.
- No direct external indexer calls in components/pages.
- Data fetching centralized in composables → Nuxt API.
- Reduced duplication; clearer structure; typed composable interfaces.

## Prohibited during refactor
- Enabling TS `strict` globally, adding Pinia, adding Playwright/Vitest.
- Cross-cutting rewrites across multiple pages in one pass.
- Removing legacy site code (defer; current task focuses on active pages).

## Working with `TODO.md`
- Record the current target page, tick each checklist item, and list cascade impacts.
- If changes affect shared composables/utils, add individual cascade tasks and pause for manual review.
